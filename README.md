# Note

This project is pretty much in an early stage. Do not rely heavily on it, nor
use it in production.

The goal is to provide basic types, written in TypeScript, that comply with Web
of Things model defined in http://model.webofthings.io.

# Installation

`$ yarn add --dev wot-model`

or

`$ npm install --save-dev wot-model`

# TODO

- Documentation (including README)
- Review build
- Tests
